## Things I Learned

This project served as a fantastic learning experience for me. Specifically, it helped me to:

- **Understand ReactJS**: Grasped the core concepts of React, including JSX, props, and component-based architecture.
- **Master React Hooks**: Leveraged React Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` to manage the state and side-effects in functional components.
- **Learn Firebase/Firestore**: Integrated Firebase for backend services, and learned how to interact with Firestore for CRUD operations.
